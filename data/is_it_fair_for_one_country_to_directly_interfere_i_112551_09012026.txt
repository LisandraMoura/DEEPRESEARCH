1. According to Source 1, the concept of intervention in international law is defined as interference of a state with the internal affairs of another state. However, it emphasizes that such interference can be lawful if it is for the sake of humanity and if the two states agree on the matter through a treaty (Source 1).

2. Source 2 defines intervention in international relations as the deliberate act of a state or group of states to interfere in the internal affairs of another sovereign state, typically through the use of force or coercion (Source 2).

However, it does discuss the concept of interventionism, which addresses the characteristics, causes, and purposes of a country's interference with another country's attitudes, policies, and behavior (Source 3).

It appears that the literature on the topic does not provide clear evidence that direct interference in another country's politics is a widely accepted or common practice in international relations.

Based on the provided web search results, here is the extracted relevant information on the subtopic "Can a country be considered a cosmopolitan state by directly intervening in another country's politics, and if so, what are the moral implications of such actions?":

1. Cosmopolitan democracy opposes military interventions, even with humanitarian intentions, and suggests popular diplomacy and arms control (Source 1).

2. Cosmopolitan democracy emphasizes egalitarian individualism, reciprocal recognition, and impartial treatment, which can be achieved through the implementation of cosmopolitan principles in international relations (Source 2).

3. Cosmopolitanism, in international relations, sees a natural order in the universe defined by social bonds that link people, communities, and societies (Source 3, Britannica.com).

4. Realists and liberals agree that the state is the dominant actor in world politics, but cosmopolitanism rejects the idea of the semiautonomous sovereign state with an exclusive right of self-government (Source 3, Britannica.com).

5. Cosmopolitanism argues that states are bound by rules, norms, and the imperatives of law, and that conflicts between states can be mediated by international institutions (Source 3, Britannica.com).

6. Cosmopolitan democracy advocates for the democratization of international organizations, including the institution of the International Criminal Court and the world parliament or world assembly of governments (Source 3, Britannica.com).

7. Cosmopolitanism moves beyond liberalism in its view of international institutions as steps down the evolutionary road toward vesting full sovereignty in people rather than in states (Source 3, Britannica.com).

8. The concept of "ius cosmopoliticum" (cosmopolitan law/right) was proposed by Immanuel Kant to protect people from war and morally grounds this principle by the principle of universal hospitality (Source 3, Britannica.com).

In terms of the moral implications of directly intervening in another country's politics, the search results do not provide a clear answer. However, they do suggest that cosmopolitan democracy emphasizes the importance of impartial treatment, reciprocal recognition, and egalitarian individualism, which can help to mitigate the moral implications of such actions.

It is also worth noting that the search results provide a nuanced and complex view of cosmopolitanism and its relationship to international relations, suggesting that the concept is multifaceted and open to interpretation.

RESPOSTA FINAL COMPILADA
======================================================================
The age-old question of whether one country has the right to directly interfere in the politics of another is a complex issue with no straightforward answer. The concept of intervention in international relations is recognized, but the practice of direct interference in another country's politics is not explicitly defended by prominent theorists or philosophers as a common or accepted intervention in international relations. According to international law, such interference can be lawful if it is for the sake of humanity and if the two states agree on the matter through a treaty.

However, when it comes to the moral implications of such actions, the picture becomes even more nuanced. Cosmopolitan democracy, which emphasizes egalitarian individualism, reciprocal recognition, and impartial treatment, suggests that popular diplomacy and arms control are essential tools for achieving this. This approach rejects military interventions, even with humanitarian intentions, and instead advocates for democratic institutions, international norms, and the rule of law. However, the concept of cosmopolitanism in international relations sees a natural order in the universe defined by social bonds that link people, communities, and societies, which can lead to conflicts between states.

In the specific case of the United States' arrest of a foreign leader, such as Maduro, the justification and legitimacy of such actions are highly contested. While the US may argue that the arrest was necessary to protect human rights or prevent a humanitarian crisis, the international community, including the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), may interpret the US capture of a serving president as a violation of international law. The Monroe Doctrine, a US foreign policy principle, may also factor into the justification for the arrest of Maduro, but this principle has been widely criticized for its lack of clear boundaries and its potential to justify interventionism.

In conclusion, while the concept of intervention in international relations is recognized, the practice of direct interference in another country's politics is a highly contested and complex issue. The moral implications of such actions are multifaceted and depend on a variety of factors, including the motivations behind the intervention, the response of the intervened country, and the international law framework that governs such actions. Ultimately, any discussion of the legitimacy of US action in arresting Maduro must be approached with caution and a deep understanding of the complex issues involved.
