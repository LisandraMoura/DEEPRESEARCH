For example, the data could be images of handwritten numbers that are annotated to indicate which numbers they represent. Given sufficient labeled data, the supervised learning system would eventually recognize the clusters of pixels and shapes associated with each handwritten number. In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms train on unlabeled data ..."
