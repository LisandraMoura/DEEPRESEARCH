Source 2: Provides information on Nietzsche's early writings and publications, but does not mention a book written by a commentator from Brazil.

RESPOSTA FINAL COMPILADA
======================================================================
Without a specific title or publication date, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact book written by a famous commentator from Brazil about Nietzsche. The available information from my internal searches suggests that the commentator, although influential in Brazil, remains unidentified. My searches revealed that Dimis Jean Soares, a director and roteirista, was initially influenced by Nietzsche's work at a young age, but there's no direct connection between him and a short book on Nietzsche.

Nietzsche's works, such as "Human, All Too Human," "The Birth of Tragedy," and "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," have been widely discussed and explored by scholars and commentators worldwide. However, none of these sources provided information about a book written by a famous commentator from Brazil on Nietzsche. The information available suggests that Nietzsche's works have gained popularity in Brazil since the year 2000, with the media and publishing market exploiting his works.

It's possible that the book you're inquiring about was published under a different title or by a different author. Alternatively, it could be a lesser-known or older work that hasn't been extensively documented online. Given the limited information available, I recommend exploring online archives, academic databases, or libraries specializing in Brazilian literary criticism to uncover more information about the book you're searching for.

If you have any additional details or context about the book, such as the author's name or a brief description, I may be able to provide more targeted guidance or suggestions for further research.
