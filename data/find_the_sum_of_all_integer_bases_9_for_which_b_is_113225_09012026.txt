Based on the provided web search results, relevant information about determining if {b} is a divisor of {b} can be extracted as follows:

1. Divisibility rules in any radix (base) exist, but they are different for each base (Source 2). However, no specific rules for base {b} are mentioned in the search results.

2. Since the search results do not provide information on the subtopic, we can consider an alternative interpretation: Given an integer base b, it is theoretically possible to determine if {b} is a divisor of {b}. However, this seems to be an unusual concept, as a number {b} cannot divide itself in the conventional sense.

3. The division algorithm (Source 3) is a standard method for dividing numbers, but it does not provide any insight into determining if a base is a divisor of itself.

4. According to Source 1, a nonzero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number. However, this does not provide any information about a specific base {b} being a divisor of itself.

In conclusion, no useful information is found in the search results that directly addresses the subtopic of determining if {b} is a divisor of {b}.

Based on the provided web search results, the following information can be extracted about the subtopic "What are the possible values of b for which {b} is a divisor of {b} and can be summed up to give a total sum?":

1. A number $a$ divides a number $b$ if there exists an integer $q$ such that $b = aq$ (equivalent to $a \mid b$). If no such integer $q$ exists, then $a$ does not divide $b$ (Source 1).
2. The division of two numbers with a remainder is also known as Euclidean division, where a quotient and a remainder are obtained (Source 2).
3. The sum of all divisors of a number $n$ can be calculated using an algorithm or a theorem, but the exact computation of this sum may not always be possible due to the presence of remainders (Source 2).

However, the provided web search results do not directly address the specific question of finding values of $b$ for which the sum of all divisors of $b$ equals $b$. It appears that no useful information is found to directly solve this subtopic.

It's worth noting that the sum of all divisors of a number is known as the "divisor sum" or "divisor function", and it has its own set of properties and formulas in number theory. However, the direct relationship between the divisor sum and the divisibility of a number is not explicitly addressed in the provided web search results.

RESPOSTA FINAL COMPILADA
======================================================================
The problem at hand revolves around finding the sum of all integer bases greater than 9 for which the set {b} is a divisor of the same set {b}. To approach this problem, we first need to consider the properties of integer bases greater than 9. Unfortunately, the available search results do not provide direct information on this topic, suggesting that further research may be necessary to establish a clear understanding of what integer bases greater than 9 entail.

However, based on the available information, it appears that integer bases greater than 9 are not explicitly defined in the provided search results. Instead, the search results discuss the properties of the integer 9, including its sum of divisors, being a regular number, and its occurrence as a square number and nonagonal number. These properties of the number 9 may offer some insight into the characteristics of integer bases greater than 9, but a definitive answer remains elusive.

From a mathematical perspective, determining if a set {b} can be a divisor of itself is an unusual concept. In conventional mathematics, a number cannot divide itself, as this would imply that the number has a non-trivial divisor. Nonetheless, if we were to consider the theoretical possibility of a base {b} being a divisor of itself, we would need to rely on the division algorithm and the concept of remainders. The division algorithm states that any integer can be represented as the product of the divisor and quotient, plus the remainder. However, applying this concept to a base {b} being a divisor of itself would not provide a clear solution to the problem at hand.

In light of the available information, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer to the original question. The properties of integer bases greater than 9 remain undefined, and the concept of a base being a divisor of itself is not explicitly addressed in the search results. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the sum of all integer bases greater than 9 for which the set {b} is a divisor of the same set {b}. Further research and clarification on the topic of integer bases greater than 9 are necessary to establish a clear understanding and potentially provide a solution to the problem.
