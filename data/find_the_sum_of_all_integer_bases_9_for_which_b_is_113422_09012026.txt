Based on the given web search results, the relevant information about the subtopic "integer bases greater than 9 that are perfect squares" can be extracted as follows:

1. Perfect squares in general: A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer (Source 1).

2. Examples of perfect squares: The search results do not provide a comprehensive list of perfect squares greater than 9. However, Source 1 mentions that the smallest perfect square is 0^2 = 0, and as integers increase, so will the perfect squares (Source 1).

3. Perfect squares in base conversion: Source 3 discusses perfect squares in base 9. It states that 9^n - 12 must be a perfect square for the greatest perfect square of 4 digits in base 9, but this information is not directly related to bases greater than 9.

4. Specific example in base 9: The same source (Source 3) mentions that 14 is a perfect square in base 10, but it does not provide any information on perfect squares in other bases greater than 9.

No useful information was found to directly address the subtopic of integer bases greater than 9 that are perfect squares. The available sources primarily focus on perfect squares in general and provide some context for base conversion, but do not specifically address the subtopic of bases greater than 9.

Based on the provided web search results, the following information can be extracted about the subtopic "What are the integer bases greater than 9 that are the square of a composite number?"

From Source 1 (Wikipedia), there is no direct information about the integer bases greater than 9 that are the square of a composite number. However, it defines composite numbers as positive integers greater than 1 that are not prime and can be factored into numbers other than 1 and themselves (Source 1).

From Source 3 (EBSCO Research), there is no information directly related to integer bases greater than 9 that are the square of a composite number. However, it does provide a definition of composite numbers as positive integers greater than 1 that are not prime (Source 3).

No relevant information can be found in Source 2 (University of Surrey) about the integer bases greater than 9 that are the square of a composite number. The content of the source is more focused on unusual number bases, factorials, and binomial coefficients bases.

As the search results do not provide any relevant information about the subtopic, it can be concluded that there is no clear answer to the question of what integer bases greater than 9 are the square of a composite number.

RESPOSTA FINAL COMPILADA
======================================================================
The problem posed by the user seeks the sum of all integer bases greater than 9 for which the base itself is a divisor of the number represented in that base. To approach this question, we must first consider the nature of bases and divisors in number systems.

Research into the topic did not yield a clear answer, as the available sources primarily focused on general concepts of perfect squares, prime and composite numbers, and unusual number bases. However, one can make an educated guess that bases greater than 9, which are perfect squares, might have the characteristic that the base itself is a divisor of the represented number. This characteristic would imply that the number represented in the base would have a factor of the base.

For bases greater than 9 that are perfect squares, the smallest perfect square greater than 9 is 10^2 = 100, which is not a divisor of 100 in base 10. However, considering the definition of a perfect square, we can infer that the square root of the base would be an integer, and this integer would be a factor of the base. Unfortunately, no useful information was found to directly address the subtopic of bases greater than 9 that are perfect squares.

Since we cannot find a clear answer to the question of what integer bases greater than 9 are perfect squares or the square of a composite number, we can consider the possibility that the sum of bases greater than 9 that satisfy the condition might be limited to bases greater than 9 that are not perfect squares. This is because there is no clear information about bases greater than 9 that are perfect squares or the square of a composite number.

However, one can consider the possibility that some bases greater than 9 might be divisors of the numbers they represent, such as bases that are factors of the numbers they represent. Given the lack of information on bases greater than 9 that are perfect squares or the square of a composite number, it is difficult to identify such bases. Nevertheless, the sum of bases greater than 9 that are divisors of the numbers they represent may be more accessible to investigation.

It appears that further research is necessary to determine the sum of bases greater than 9 that are divisors of the numbers they represent. This could involve investigating other number systems, exploring different mathematical concepts, and considering alternative approaches to solving the problem.
